        JR'S is a website owned by a student currently studying at Nile University and is devoted to providing affordable sneakers and shoes to students in the universities around Nigeria and workers at large.
        The idea of starting up this enterprise was driven by our love for shoes here at JR'S and the passion to provide affordable shoes to people with either low or high budgets as well as making profits. 
        While you are browsing through this site you can take a moment to read my short story about shoes.....
        
        
        If only my shoes could talk… What an amazing story they would tell! An adventure full of academics,comedy, mystery, romance, but all rolled up into one tale. Really, what else is with you through all of the important moments in your life? Shoes are such a simple accessory and often chosen as an afterthought when the perfect outfit is picked out. If you think about it though, they really are an integral part. I think of my shoes as a companion who listens without judgment. They are a friend who offers support and comfort but still offers me a pinch every once in awhile to bring me back to reality.

        I don’t remember my first steps but I know my shoes were there with me. I can imagine my parents holding my hands preparing to release me into my first stage of independence. What a scary moment it must have been for all of us. As they released my little fingers, it was then that those tiny shoes kept me balanced. Sure there were trips and falls along the way, but my shoes and I quickly began to work together. We were soon skipping, jumping, and running together. My shoes always told the tale of what I had done that day. If inspected carefully, one could even see spatters of what I had eaten that day. Somehow, Mom always knew if I had been running through the garden again.

        My shoes were with me on the first day of school. As I walked up to the front door of the big building I shuffled my feet. Somehow the muffled sound of my brand new shoes against the pavement made the walk a little less scary. My shoes got to witness my very first art project. My little white sneakers were a beautiful collage of color when we were through. Who knew the paint would drip off the brush like that? My shoes could even tell the tale of the mean boy who splattered ketchup all over my new dress. I bet my shoes felt left out! What stories they could tell about running free on the play yard without a care in the world. If my shoes could talk, I bet they would tell all about the time I won the big recess race.
        
        When I was eight, my shoes were with me to experience my first big heartache. As my parent sat me down for a serious talk, I stared down at my shoes blankly. They talked about how they love me and everything would be fine. As I began to realize what they were telling me, I knew I hated the word divorce. I wondered why parents couldn’t be like shoes. Shoes were a pair for life and were no good without the other. I wonder if my shoes would talk about what it felt like when my little tears rained down on them like a spring shower. My shoes were there to support me each time I walked through the doors to their separate houses.


        My shoes have played a very important part in my life. They have witnessed all of the good and bad times in my life, and they will be there to witness many more.
